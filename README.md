This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Looking to appropriately value BTC based off node distribution, rather than quote the price in USD.

This project will pull the number of nodes globally for BTC, find their local currency, and appropriate value BTC based off a global financial view. More to come.
